# History
It was created in March 2023 as an exercise document for “LSI Circuit Design I”, a class for third-year undergraduate students.

I created the entire development environment, lab data, and documentation, and conducted the exercises in 2023 and 2024 when I was enrolled in the university.

Concurrently, I have also conducted almost the same hands-on in ISHI-KAI. Several have been performed, the first is in November 2023.
